A Python package for generating motion heatmaps from video sequences. This package allows you to analyze areas of motion within a sequence of images by highlighting these areas in a heatmap.

## Features

- Generate motion heatmaps from a sequence of images.
- Highlight areas of motion within the images.
- Customize the appearance of the heatmap, including color intensity and smoothing.

## Installation

To install `MotionHeatmapGenerator`, you can use pip:
# MotionHeatmapGenerator# MotionHeatmapGenerator

pip install MotionHeatmapGenerator
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use `MotionHeatmapGenerator`:

python from MotionHeatmapGenerator import MotionHeatmapGenerator
Initialize the generator with the desired number of divisions and a list of images

generator = MotionHeatmapGenerator(num_vertical_divisions=2, num_horizontal_divisions=2, images=["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"])
Generate the motion heatmap

generator.generate_motion_heatmap("output_heatmap.jpg")


This will generate a motion heatmap from the provided images and save it as `output_heatmap.jpg`.
